# My First CLI Project

**Link to project:** [Task Tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)

---

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** Python, JSON, .bat file  

---

## Lessons Learned

- Function declaration and scope (global vs local variables)  
- Using Python modules like `sys`, `os`, and `datetime`  
- Creating a script that communicates directly via a CLI  
- The importance of configuring the PATH so that the CLI detects Python  
- Handling JSON file read/write and basic file operations  
- Building a simple task tracker CLI from scratch

Tips & Tricks (Windows / PowerShell)

To run the CLI from anywhere, make sure the folder containing task-cli.bat is added to your PATH environment variable.

Use quotes " " around task descriptions if they contain spaces.

You can combine commands to update or mark tasks as done directly after adding them.

If Python is not recognized, check that Python is installed and its Scripts folder is in PATH:

C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\
C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\
